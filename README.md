# Black Jack

This is a OO Ruby exercise that builds out the logic for a BlackJack game in
four classes.

* Card: guides via failing tests through building an object
* Deck: also guides through tests to working with Card objects in another object
* Hand: starts with guiding tests and transitions to writing tests. It is a stretch exercise
* Game: is completely unmapped and intended for stretch use only

#### Gems

It only comes with the 'rspec' gem for testing. It also comes with files that
set the ruby version and the gemset. Once you pull down this project once, and
bundle gems, you shouldn't have to do it again. Your computer should just know
which Ruby and gemset to use.

## Exercise
1. `bundle` to get your gems
2. Follow the failing tests to build the Card and Deck classes

## Stretches
1. Hand requires that your start writing your own tests and algorithms
2. Game is completely unmapped and requires you to create a game algorithm from
tests down
